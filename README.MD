# A super simple Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) implemented in Pytorch

- The notebook shows the data loading, model creating, training, results, etc
- Heavily drawn from this Pytorch tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html
- Currently only using the MNIST dataset; generating images of hand-drawn digits
- Will add more things as time permits, like other datasets and scripts
- Data is downloaded using torchvision (see the notebook)
